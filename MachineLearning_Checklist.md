1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.
Designing the system:
	supervised? Unsupervised? Reinforcement learning?
	classification? Regression? Other?
	RMSE vs MAE -- RMSE more sensitive to outliers
	check assumptions
2. Get the data.
3. Explore the data and gain insights.
4. Prepare the dat to better expose underlying patterns to ML algorithms. 
5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones.
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.
7. Present your solution. 
8. Luanch and maintain your system.
